 Fortunately or unfortunately, the whole past week was as boring as possible for me. There were no big holidays and events that were interesting for me. In fact, I don‚Äôt regret at all that I spent the past week under the covers and with TV shows, because sometimes we all need a break. But now, with renewed vigor, I can study and work even better!
